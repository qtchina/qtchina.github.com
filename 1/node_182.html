<title>天下有比grep实现更好、更快、更强大的grep吗</title>
</head>
<body>
如果你没有看到这个软件，看到它的介绍，真正试用，真的是很难相信。<br />
<br />
这个软件的名字叫<a href="http://petdance.com/ack/" target="_blank">ack</a> , 其网站标榜: "better than grep, a search tool for programmers"<br />
<br />
一个gentoo开发人员对其评介为”令人激动的、在某些情况下可替换grep的新工具"，并且他还对 <a href="http://petdance.com/ack/" target="_blank">ack</a> 站点列出的“十大胜出理由“一一做了解释。<br />
<br />
但是这个软件即使更快也不能完全取代grep，因为它运行的时候用到perl解释器及perl标准模块。<br />
既然用perl解释的，那么它怎么能比c写的grep快呢？ That's really a problem.<br />
<br />
这个gentoo开发人员在写一个ack的每日小技巧的文档，链接是： <a href="http://blog.i-no.de/archives/2008/05/07/index.html#e2008-05-07T21_31_43.txt" target="_blank">ack 每日小技巧</a><br />

<h2>十大胜出理由:</h2><br />

<h3>It's blazingly fast because it only searches the stuff you want<br />
searched.</h3><br />
<p>Wait, how does it know what I want? A <a href=<br />
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM">DWIM</a>-Interface at last? Not<br />
quite. First off, <tt>ack</tt> <i>is</i> faster than <tt>grep</tt><br />
for simple searches. Here's an example:</p><br />
<pre><br />
$ time ack 1Jsztn-000647-SL exim_main.log &gt;/dev/null<br />
real    0m3.463s<br />
user    0m3.280s<br />
sys     0m0.180s<br />
$ time grep -F 1Jsztn-000647-SL exim_main.log &gt;/dev/null<br />
real    0m14.957s<br />
user    0m14.770s<br />
sys     0m0.160s<br />
</pre><br />
<p>Two notes: first, yes, the file was in the page cache before I<br />
ran ack; second, I even made it easy for <tt>grep</tt> by telling<br />
it explicitly I was looking for a fixed string (not that it helped<br />
much, the same command without <tt>-F</tt> was faster by about<br />
0.1s). Oh and for completeness, the exim logfile I searched has<br />
about two million lines and is 250M. I've run those tests ten times<br />
for each, the times shown above are typical.</p><br />
<p>So yes, for simple searches, <tt>ack</tt> is faster than grep.<br />
Let's try with a more complicated pattern, then. This time, let's<br />
use the pattern <tt>(klausman|gentoo)</tt> on the same file. Note<br />
that we have to use <tt>-E</tt> for <tt>grep</tt> to use extended<br />
regexen, which <tt>ack</tt> in turn does not need, since it<br />
(almost) always uses them. Here, <tt>grep</tt> takes its sweet<br />
time: 3:56, nearly four minutes. In contrast, <tt>ack</tt><br />
accomplished the same task in 49 seconds (all times averaged over<br />
ten runs, then rounded to integer seconds).</p><br />
<p>As for the "being clever" side of speed, see below, points 5 and<br />
6</p><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>ack is pure Perl, so it runs on Windows just fine.</h3><br />
<p>This isn't relevant to me, since I don't use windows for<br />
anything where I might need grep. That said, it might be a killer<br />
feature for others.</p><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>The standalone version uses no non-standard modules, so you can<br />
put it in your ~/bin without fear.</h3><br />
<p>Ok, this is not so much of a feature than a hard criterion. If I<br />
needed extra modules for the whole thing to run, that'd be a deal<br />
breaker. I already have tons of libraries, I don't need more<br />
undergrowth around my dependency tree.</p><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>Searches recursively through directories by default, while<br />
ignoring .svn, CVS and other VCS directories.</h3><br />
<p>This is a feature, yet one that wouldn't pry me away from grep:<br />
<tt>-r</tt> is there (though it distinctly feels like an<br />
afterthought). Since <tt>ack</tt> ignores a certain set of files<br />
and directories, its recursive capabilities where there from the<br />
start, making it feel more seamless.</p><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>ack ignores most of the crap you don't want to search</h3><br />
<p>To be precise:</p><br />
<blockquote><br />
<ul><br />
<li>VCS directories</li><br />
<li>blib, the Perl build directory</li><br />
<li>backup files like foo~ and #foo#</li><br />
<li>binary files, core dumps, etc.</li><br />
</ul><br />
</blockquote><br />
<p>Most of the time, I don't want to search those (and have to<br />
exclude them with <tt>grep -v</tt> from <tt>find</tt> results). Of<br />
course, this ignore-mode can be switched off with <tt>ack</tt><br />
(<tt>-u</tt>). All that said, it sure makes command lines shorter<br />
(and easier to read and construct). Also, this is the first spot<br />
where ack's Perl-centricism shows. I don't mind, even though I<br />
prefer that <a href="http://python.org/">other language with<br />
P</a>.</p><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>Ignoring .svn directories means that ack is faster than grep<br />
for searching through trees.</h3><br />
<p>Dupe. See Point 5</p><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>Lets you specify file types to search, as in --perl or<br />
--nohtml.</h3><br />
<p>While at first glance, this may seem limited, <tt>ack</tt> comes<br />
with a plethora of definitions (45 if I counted correctly), so it's<br />
not as perl-centric as it may seem from the example. This feature<br />
saves command-line space (if there's such a thing), since it avoids<br />
wild find-constructs. The docs mention that <tt>--perl</tt> also<br />
checks the shebang line of files that don't have a suffix, but make<br />
no mention of the other "shipped" file type recognizers doing<br />
so.</p><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>File-filtering capabilities usable without searching with ack<br />
-f. This lets you create lists of files of a given type.</h3><br />
<p>This mostly is a consequence of the feature above. Even if it<br />
weren't there, you could simply search for "."</p><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>Color highlighting of search results.</h3><br />
<p>While I've looked upon color in shells as kinda childish for a<br />
while, I wouldn't want to miss syntax highlighting in vim, colors<br />
for ls (if they're not as sucky as the defaults we had for years)<br />
or match highlighting for grep. It's really neat to see that yes,<br />
the pattern you grepped for indeed matches what you think it does.<br />
Especially during evolutionary construction of command lines and<br />
shell scripts.</p><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>Uses real Perl regular expressions, not a GNU subset</h3><br />
<p>Again, this doesn't bother me much. I use<br />
<tt>egrep</tt>/<tt>grep -E</tt> all the time, anyway. And I'm no<br />
Perl programmer, so I don't get withdrawal symptoms every time I<br />
use another regex engine.</p><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>Allows you to specify output using Perl's special<br />
variables</h3><br />
<p>This <i>sounds</i> neat, yet I don't really have a use case for<br />
it. Also, my perl-fu is weak, so I probably won't use it anyway.<br />
Still, might be a killer feature for you.</p><br />
<p>The docs have an example:</p><br />
<blockquote>ack '(Mr|Mr?s)\. (Smith|Jones)'<br />
--output='$&amp;'</blockquote><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>Many command-line switches are the same as in GNU grep:</h3><br />
<p>Specifically mentioned are <tt>-w</tt>, <tt>-c</tt> and<br />
<tt>-l</tt>. It's always nice if you don't have to look up all the<br />
flags every time.</p><br />
</li><br />
<li><br />
<h3>Command name is 25% fewer characters to type! Save days of<br />
free-time! Heck, it's 50% shorter compared to grep -r</h3><br />
<p>Okay, now we have proof that not only the <tt>ack</tt> webmaster<br />
can't count, he's also making up reasons for fun. Works for me.</p><br />
