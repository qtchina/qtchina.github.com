If you have ever been interested in awk and sed Unix utilities, then you probably know about the <a href="http://www.pement.org/awk/awk1line.txt">awk1line.txt</a> and <a href="http://student.northpark.edu/pemente/sed/sed1line.txt">sed1line.txt</a> files that are floating around the Internet. Each file contains around 80 idiomatic sed and awk one-liners for performing various text modification tasks.<p>Making my way through them was not easy and I decided to write two articles explaining every one-liner in these files. It took me several months to finish them, but now I am proud that I did it.
</p><p>
Here is the Awk One-Liners Explained article: <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/awk-one-liners-explained-part-one/">Part One</a>, <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/awk-one-liners-explained-part-two/">Part Two</a>, <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/awk-one-liners-explained-part-three/">Part Three</a>, <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/update-on-famous-awk-one-liners-explained/">Part Four (bonus)</a>.
</p><p>
And here is the Sed One-Liners Explained article: <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/sed-one-liners-explained-part-one/">Part One</a>, <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/sed-one-liners-explained-part-two/">Part Two</a>, <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/sed-one-liners-explained-part-three/">Part Three</a>.
</p><p>
My future plans are to publish a free ebook with all the one-liners. If you are interested, please visit my site after a few months. I'll publish it there.</p>
