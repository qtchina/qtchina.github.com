<p align="justify"><a name="cp-content">September 6, 2007 (The INTERNET). The KDE Community proudly presents the <strong>second Beta release for KDE 4.0</strong>. This release marks the beginning of the feature freeze and the stabilization of the current codebase. Simultaneously the </a><a href="http://www.koffice.org/">KOffice</a> developers have released their <a href="http://www.koffice.org/releases/2.0alpha3-release.php">third Alpha release</a>, marking significant improvements in this innovative office suite. Both <a href="http://behindkde.org/people/soc2007-one/">KDE</a> and <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1188249220/">KOffice</a> have benefited from the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/kde/about.html">Google Summer of Code</a>, as most resulting code has now been merged.</p><br />

<em>The KDE Desktop in Beta 2</em></center><br />
<p>Since the libraries were frozen with the <a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-4.0-beta1.php">first Beta</a>, KDE developers have been adding features and functionality to their applications. Now it is time to start polishing these features; writing and translating documentation, improving the usability, and completing the artwork.  As KDE 4.0 is feature-frozen now, going into bugfixing mode, major ideas and changes will be held off until 4.1. However, some KDE components, such as <a href="http://plasma.kde.org/">Plasma</a>, are exempt from this freeze and will still see significant improvements.</p><br />
<h2>Current status</h2><br />
<p>Many parts of KDE have seen improvements over the last month, not least thanks to the inclusion of the results of the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/kde/about.html">Google Summer of Code</a>. In the following sections, we will highlight some of the most visible changes and improvements.</p><br />
<h3>Architectural</h3><br />
<div style="border: medium none ; margin: 1ex; padding: 2ex; float: left;"><a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce_4.0-beta2/mosfet-big.png"> 		<img border="0" src="http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce_4.0-beta2/mosfet-small.png" alt="" />  	</a><br /><br />
<em><center>Mosfet's code in action</center></em></div><br />
<p>Long time KDE developer <a href="http://cia.vc/stats/author/mosfet/">Daniel M. Duley (a.k.a. Mosfet)</a> <a href="http://commit-digest.org/issues/2007-08-12/moreinfo/698744/">rejoined us</a>. He has been working on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qimageblitz">Blitz</a>, a graphics library designed to fill the gap in the KDE libraries whilst we wait for <a href="http://zrusin.blogspot.com/">Zack Rusin's</a> Quasar. He introduced himself and his work (again) in the <a href="http://commit-digest.org/issues/2007-08-19/">Commit Digest</a>. And it is not just Blitz which is on his mind, he <a href="http://daniel-duley.livejournal.com/1582.html">is working hard on</a> high performance, yet easy to use <a href="http://commit-digest.org/issues/2007-08-19/files/scaledbackground2.png">graphical</a> <a href="http://daniel-duley.livejournal.com/1822.html">tricks</a> for the KDE developers.</p><br />
<p>Another basic component of the KDE libraries also received some attention. <a href="http://cia.vc/stats/author/marchand/">Mickael Marchand</a> <a href="http://commit-digest.org/issues/2007-08-19/moreinfo/699749/#changes">spent some time</a> on Kconfig, the configuration system for KDE. When committed, his work will enable support for several different backends for the KDE configuration, including a SQL database.</p><br />
<p>Meanwhile, several developers <a href="http://people.fruitsalad.org/adridg/bobulate/index.php?/archives/449-Sun-Studio-and-const.html">immersed themselves</a> in providing better support for *BSD and OpenSolaris in KDE. And <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1176310483/">Strigi</a> <a href="http://www.flavio.castelli.name/query_strigi_using_xesam">now</a> <a href="http://kemistry-desktop.blogspot.com/2007/08/strigi-now-understands-xesam-queries.html">has</a> <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/XesamAbout">XESAM</a> <a href="http://www.flavio.castelli.name/strigi_xesam_query_language_support">support</a>. XESAM is an effort initiated by the strigi developers, and now continued on <a href="http://freedesktop.org/">freedesktop.org</a> with the purpose of creating a cross-desktop  interface for searching and metadata-usage in applications and tools.</p><br />
<div style="border: medium none ; margin: 1ex; padding: 2ex; float: right;"><a href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce_4.0-beta2/avogadro-big.png"> 		<img border="0" src="http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce_4.0-beta2/avogadro-small.png" alt="" /> 	</a><br /><br />
<em>Avogadro graphical goodies</em></div><br />
<p><a href="http://blog.cryos.net/">Marcus</a> <a href="http://blog.cryos.net/archives/153-Avogadro-Gets-More-Eye-Candy-Visual-Cues.html">continued</a> to <a href="http://blog.cryos.net/archives/154-Avogadro-and-POV-Ray-Export.html">work</a> on the <a href="http://avogadro.sourceforge.net/wiki/">Avogadro</a> 3D molecule visualisation library and its integration in <a href="http://edu.kde.org/kalzium/">Kalzium</a>. Chemical data is in good hands on the KDE desktop these days, seeing how also <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1176310483/">Strigi</a> also <a href="http://neksa.blogspot.com/2007/08/strigi-chemical-gsoc-final-timeline.html">received support for</a> <a href="http://neksa.blogspot.com/2007/08/strigi-now-extracts-chemical.html">chemical</a> <a href="http://neksa.blogspot.com/2007/08/mdl-sd-file-support.html">files</a>.</p><br />
<p><a href="http://blog.hartwork.org/">Sebastian Pipping</a> spent a lot of time on <a href="http://www.kate-editor.org/">Kate</a>, KDE's advanced text editor (or lightweight Development Environment). He <a href="http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=70">improved</a> the way <a href="http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=65">search works</a> in Kate, both making it more powerful and easier to use. Now the component used in Kate to edit text is used throughout KDE for pretty much every text input widget you see, thus applications like Kwrite but also Konqueror will benefit from these advancements!</p><br />
<p>Another area where Kate inspired some improvements with broad effect is the plugin dialog. This was initiated by <a href="http://www.ereslibre.es/">Rafael Fern&aacute;ndez L&oacute;pez?</a> who <a href="http://www.ereslibre.es/?p=59">started to improve it</a>, and then integrated his work in other applications like <a href="http://www.ereslibre.es/?p=61">Kopete</a>. Many comments on his work were made, especially on his <a href="http://www.ereslibre.es/">blog</a>, and work is still going on. He did get some <a href="http://commit-digest.org/issues/2007-08-26/moreinfo/704390/#changes">help</a> in the coding area, and on his blog you can see how many tried to help him improve the plugin dialog.</p><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p><br />
<h3>Applications</h3><br />
<p>The applications have received a lot of attention from their developers. For example, <a href="http://commit-digest.org/issues/2007-07-29/moreinfo/692114/">Kolourpaint saw many features merged.</a> And not only has it seen usability work and new effects, but the application has become a lot more robust. Better handling of text, improved scanning support and session management are just a few things that have been improved in this easy-to-use image editor. Our old and trusted KGPG got some <a href="http://cia.vc/stats/project/kde/kgpg">love</a>, in the usability area but also concerning features. And <a href="http://okular.kde.org/">Okular</a> received further <a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/2922">usability work</a>. <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> saw <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/blog/archives/467-Amarok-Plasmification.html">integration</a> with <a href="http://plasma.kde.org/">plasma</a>, where plasma will provide the infrastructure for the now much more central Context View. Imagine the ability to drag'n'drop items from the context view on the desktop or to and from the panels on the side of the screen!</p><br />

<h3>Summer of Code</h3><br />
<p>A big, visible bulk of application and infrastructural work was added to KDE when the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/kde/about.html">Google Summer of Code</a> students added their work. We will go through some of these additions, but if you want to read more we recommend the <a href="http://dot.kde.org/">dot</a> article about the <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1188249220/">KOffice SoC results</a> and the excellent interview series with Summer of Code students on <a href="http://behindkde.org/">People Behind KDE</a>, starting <a href="http://behindkde.org/people/soc2007-one/">here</a>.</p><br />

<p><a href="http://bertjan.broeksemaatjes.nl/">Bertjan Broeksema</a> has spent his summer working on <a href="http://cvs.codeyard.net/kpilot/">KPilot</a>. His mentor, <a href="http://www.movingparts.net/">Jason 'vanRijn' Kasper</a> <a href="http://movingparts.net/2007/08/18/wrapping-up-the-summer-of-code/">mentioned</a> on his blog how this work lead to a much improved infrastructure and a port to KDE 4, allowing the other  developers to integrate new features and leverage frameworks like <a href="http://www.opensync.org/">OpenSync</a>. Meanwhile, the other <a href="http://pim.kde.org/">KDE PIM</a> applications also received some love. <a href="http://kontact.kde.org/korganizer/">KOrganizer</a> had <a href="http://mikearthur.co.uk/">Mike Arthur</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/kde/appinfo.html?csaid=CE22F8A7E2641D25">working on better blog support</a> and <a href="http://blog.loic.corbasson.fr/">Lo&iuml;c Corbasson</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/kde/appinfo.html?csaid=5D66C1579098460C">improving the look and feel</a>.</p><br />
<p><a href="http://uwolfer.fwo.ch/blog">Urs Wolfer's</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/kde/appinfo.html?csaid=9064143E62AF5BA6">work</a> on KRDC, the KDE Remote Desktop Client is finished as well. Making use of <a href="http://libnvserver.sourceforge.net/">libraries</a> ensures the application's maintainability in the long run. Coupled with new features like a tabbed interface and much improved configuration, users can count on a greatly improved remote desktop experience in KDE 4.0 -- and beyond, as Urs is comitted to continue working on it! <a href="http://opsiland.blogspot.com/">Juan Gonz&agrave;lez Aguilera</a> also spent time getting some older tools freshened up, focusing on <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/kde/appinfo.html?csaid=97E78A84F9F491CF">Bluetooth support in KDE</a>.</p><br />
<p><a href="http://www.proli.net/">Aleix Pol Gonz&agrave;lez</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/kde/appinfo.html?csaid=D8C84D62733DAD1">ensured</a> that <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/">Kdevelop</a> has proper <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> support, while <a href="http://meson10.wordpress.com/">Piyush Verma</a> worked on <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> integration in this great development tool. And <a href="http://youonlylivetwice.info/">Nick Shaforostoff</a> developed <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/kde/appinfo.html?csaid=85B77CD7BD8B30B1">KAider</a>, a tool to help the KDE translation teams to quickly and efficiently translate KDE in the many languages we support. This application won't make it into the official KDE 4.0 builds, but no doubt our translators will find it anyway...</p><br />
<p>The <a href="http://edu.kde.org/">KDE education project</a> received exciting work on <a href="http://edu.kde.org/step/">step</a> (the KDE physics simulator) by <a href="http://ksvladimir.blogspot.com/">Vladimir Kuznetsov</a> and on <a href="http://edu.kde.org/kalzium">Kalzium</a> by <a href="http://blog.cryos.net/">Marcus Hanwell</a>.

<p>Further work was done on <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/kde/appinfo.html?csaid=F3389CEA023E0E9D">Kopete</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/kde/appinfo.html?csaid=FBBF1AFF3A34E55B">KWin</a> and more applications. The <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/kde/about.html">Google Summer of Code page</a> has more complete information.</p><br />
<h2>Next up</h2><br />
<p>The following months will see fanatical work to stabilize the KDE applications and libraries, and the finishing touch on the components not yet frozen. Two further beta's are planned, after which KDE will be frozen for a release candidate cycle ending in a release planned around Christmas at the end of the year.</p><br />
<h3>Get it, run it, test it...</h3><br />
<p>For those interested in getting packages to test and contribute, several distributions notified us that they will have KDE 4.0 Beta 2 packages available at or soon after the release. The complete and current list can be found on the <a href="http://www.kde.org/info/3.93.php"> KDE 4.0 Beta 2 Info Page</a>.</p><br />
<h2>KOffice Releases Third Alpha</h2><br />

<em>Kword is getting usable</em></center><br />
<p>Along with KDE 4.0 Beta 2, KOffice releases its <a href="http://www.koffice.org/announcements/announce-2.0alpha3.php">third alpha version</a>. This version is getting a bit more mature and usable, but still counts as a technology preview. This way, the public can  catch a gleam of what is coming in KOffice version 2.0. It does not have the same level of maturity as the rest of KDE 4.0 Beta 2.</p><br />
<p>Much work has been done on the basics, like shape loading in KPresenter and KSpread, porting some filters for Karbon, improvements in KChart2 and stability and usability work across the board. There was time for other improvements as well -- for example, frames can now have a text runaround which is <a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/2911">completely changable</a> using the vector tools, which is great for images in KWord. Kexi is not only ported to Qt 4, but the developers are already including new features like a <a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/2955">tabbed toolbar</a> (<a href="http://koffice.org/kexi/pics/2.0/alpha3/tabbed_toolbar/">video demo</a>) to improve user's experience in a new way.</p><br />
<p>Although KOffice is included in KDE 4.0 Beta 2, it has its own release cycle, and the first version of the KOffice version 2 series is expected around the new year 2007-2008.</p><br />
