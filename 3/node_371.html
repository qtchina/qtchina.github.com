<title>gentoo 中 license mask的包解决办法</title>
</head>
<body>
一些和license相关的协议问题,目前不需要怎么关心这个东西,所以可以根据portage机制,打开所有有限制协议的包<br />
<br />
portage 输出为:<br />
localhost virtualbox-bin # emerge -va virtualbox-bin<br />
^@<br />
These are the packages that would be merged, in order:<br />
<br />
Calculating dependencies... done!<br />
<br />
!!! All ebuilds that could satisfy "app-emulation/virtualbox-bin" have been masked.<br />
!!! One of the following masked packages is required to complete your request:<br />
- app-emulation/virtualbox-bin-3.0.10 (masked by: PUEL license(s))<br />
A copy of the 'PUEL' license is located at '/usr/portage/licenses/PUEL'.<br />
<br />
- app-emulation/virtualbox-bin-3.0.8 (masked by: PUEL license(s))<br />
- app-emulation/virtualbox-bin-3.0.6-r1 (masked by: PUEL license(s))<br />
- app-emulation/virtualbox-bin-3.0.6 (masked by: PUEL license(s))<br />
- app-emulation/virtualbox-bin-1.6.6 (masked by: PUEL license(s))<br />
<br />
For more information, see the MASKED PACKAGES section in the emerge<br />
man page or refer to the Gentoo Handbook.<br />
<br />
<br />
在make.conf中添加这么一行:<br />
ACCEPT_LICENSE="*"<br />
<br />
或者把*替换成要解禁的协议类型, 如PUEL(virtualbox-bin)等.<br />
如果使用*,则不受任何协议限制的emerge所有软件包.<br />
