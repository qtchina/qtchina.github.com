<title>关于PC EFI和Chameleon</title>
</head>
<body>
普通PC是使用BIOS的，而MACOSX必须EFI才能支持，为了在普通PC上安装MACOSX系统，人们想出了模拟EFI支持的办法来安装，当然这是非法的，俗称Hackintosh或者黑苹果。用的比较广泛的EFI是PC EFI，而Chameleon(变色龙)则包装使用了PC EFI，所以只需要安装Chameleon就可以了。

what is PC EFI ?
PC EFI is a technology to run Mac OS X on any pc with close to macs specs, without any modifications to osx kernel.
Is it legal ?
Yes, it’s legal to have this files, because it’s built from sources apple provided, before apsl2 was changed a year ago.
How it can be used?
It can be used in two ways - installing to hfs partition using startupfiletool and using grub to boot bootloader.
What else I need to run OSX on my pc ?
You need a legal copy of MacOSX  (you can buy it at apple.com) and small kext to emulate apple’s “tpm”(which is actualy smc device).
What a difference between diskXsX and rdiskXsX?
diskXsX is a disk device which can be mounted, but when it mounter, it can’t be accessed
(about root partition) , rdiskXsX cab be accessed any time, for read or write operations.
