<br />
<P><A name="TS1">(1) Opera File Formats --</A><br />
<P>These are based on <A HREF="http://www.opera.com/docs/fileformats/">http://www.opera.com/docs/fileformats/</A> by Yngve Pettersen combined with my observations of the file contents. There may be significant items I've missed<br />
<P>All numerical data is stored most significant byte first, which makes it easy to read from a hex dump. Time values are currently in the 4 byte signed seconds after 1 Jan. 1970 00:00:00 GMT format which is supported on most platforms.<br />
<P>a. General format for cookies, cache index, and visited links<br />
<PRE><br />
Header:<br />
  Hex  00001000<br />
  Hex  00002000=cookies, Hex 00020000=cache or visited links<br />
  Hex  0001     This indicates the size of tags (1 byte)<br />
  Hex  0002     This indicates the size of length fields (2 bytes)<br />
</PRE><br />
<P>(The format allows for longer tags and/or length fields in the<br />
future. O4FE is not coded for that, so will reject any file<br />
with different values in the header.)<br />
<P>Body:<br />
<P>Each piece of data has a tag. There's one set of tag definitions for cookies, another common to the cache index and visited links. Most tags are followed by a length field, then the number of bytes of information indicated by that length. Other tags simply indicate a 'true if present' state and have no length field or content; such tags have their most significant bit set (hex 80 and above for the current single byte tags).<br />
<P>Some tags are record tags which form a container for one or more pieces of tagged data. The others contain only one piece of data with a specific type (string, unsigned, or signed numerical). In the descriptions I'll use indentation to indicate which tags may occur within specific record types. The tags will be in hexadecimal form expressed as 0xNN where NN are the actual hex digits.<br />
<P>&nbsp;<br />
<P>b. Cookies File (cookies4.dat)<br />
<P>The file represents a tree structure. Starting at the beginning the entries work from the root to the first leaf, then back to a branch and out to the second leaf, etc. The data closest to the root is the most basic part of the domain; .com, .net, etc.<br />
<P>O4FE's internal version of the file is split into a forest of single-leaf saplings, each having all elements back to the root. This allows easy deletion or addition of saplings, and the Save operation recombines them into the Opera tree format.<br />
<P>There are 3 basic record tags; one for domain elements, one for path elements, and one for the cookie contents. There are additional tags for the data within those records, and also tags to back down through the path and domain elements.<br />
<PRE><br />
0x01  Domain entry (record).<br />
<br />
  0x1E  Domain element name (string).<br />
  0x1F  Cookie server accept flags. Content is a numerical value:<br />
         1 = Accept all from domain.          O4FE status '1'<br />

         3 = Accept all from server.          O4FE status '3'<br />

0x84  End of domain (true if present). This backs down one domain<br />
        level, and is used at the end of the file to back out of<br />

<br />
0x85  End of path (true if present). This backs down one path level,<br />
        and is used one more time than the number of path elements.<br />

        empty.<br />

<P><A name="TS2">(2) Netscape Cookie File format --</A><br />
<P>This is my own analysis of the format, and describes what O4FE will currently accept.<br />
<P>The file is plain text, and each line ends with two carriage returns and a line feed.<br />
It begins with a header (between the lines):<br />
<PRE><br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
# Netscape HTTP Cookie File<br />
# http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html<br />
# This is a generated file!  Do not edit.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
</PRE><br />
<P>Cookies exported by IE to the Netscape format are similar, but end lines with two line feeds. The header is:<br />
<PRE><br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
#  Internet Explorer cookie file, exported for Netscape browsers.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
</PRE><br />
<P>O4FE starts by skipping any number of empty lines or lines beginning with a '#' character. Lines may be terminated by one or more carriage returns or line feeds in any combination.<br />
<P>The cookies data is seven fields per line, each field separated from the next by a single space character or a single tab. O4FE replaces all the spaces, tabs, carriage returns and line feeds with zeroes so the fields can be treated as null terminated strings. The seven fields are:<BR><br />
 1. Host or domain. If this contains only numerical characters and dots, O4FE stores it as a single string to match the Opera 3.5+ format for IP addresses. Otherwise it is broken into substrings by dots, and must have at least 2 substrings or O4FE outputs a File Parse Error and quits trying to read the file.<BR><br />
 2. Either "TRUE" or "FALSE", where TRUE means that field 1 was specified by the optional 'domain=' cookie attribute and FALSE means field 1 is the host which sent the cookie. Any other contents cause a File Parse Error.<BR><br />
 3. Path. This field may be empty if there was no 'path=' attribute, but usually has a '/' character and on rare occasions has multiple path elements strung together. If so, O4FE stores the path element substrings indicated by the slashes.<BR><br />
 4. Either "TRUE" or "FALSE", where TRUE means the cookie is secure, FALSE not. O4FE saves the status, or quits with a File Parse Error.<BR><br />
 5. Expiration Date/Time, expressed as seconds after 1 Jan. 1970 00:00:00 GMT. O4FE reduces this to a binary number, and adjusts it by the local standard time offset to match the way Opera does it.<BR><br />
 6. Cookie Name. O4FE just stores it unless it's empty or longer than 4096 bytes, either of which will cause O4FE to issue a File Parse Error.<BR><br />
 7. Cookie Value. O4FE just stores it unless it's empty or longer than 4096 bytes, either of which will cause O4FE to issue a File Parse Error.<br />
<P>After the seventh field O4FE steps over any extra zero bytes, then expects field 1 unless it has reached the end of the file.<br />
<P>&nbsp;<br />
<P><A name="TS3">(3) O4FE Custom Clipboard Formats --</A><br />
<P>a. CF_OFEVLCAGH<br />
<P>This is the format used when copying from Visited Links, Cache index, or Global History.<br />
<PRE><br />
DWORD    32 bit total length of clip (Intel format, LSB first)<br />
LONG     32 bit number of lines in clip (Intel format, LSB first)<br />
<br />
Each line has:<br />
  MWORD    16 bit length of Title (MSB first) This is 0 if copying from<br />
           Visited Links or Cache index<br />
  ASCII    Title (if any)<br />
  MWORD    16 bit length of URL (MSB first)<br />
  ASCII    URL<br />
  TIME     32 bit Date/Time, seconds since 1 Jan. 1970 00:00:00 (LSB first)<br />
</PRE><br />
<P>Note: This format is identical to that used by OFE for this data, allowing you to Copy and Paste between O4FE and OFE.<br />
<P>&nbsp;<br />
<P>b. CF_O4FCOOKIE<br />
<P>This is the format used when copying from Cookies.<br />
<PRE><br />
DWORD    32 bit total length of clip (Intel format, LSB first)<br />
LONG     32 bit number of lines in clip (Intel format, LSB first)<br />
</PRE><br />
<P>Each line contains a cookie record in the same format as the Opera cookies4.dat file records but with all elements specified.<br />
<P>Note: This format differs from the CF_OFECOOKIE format used by OFE, so Copy and Paste of cookie information between the two programs is not currently possible.<br />
<P>&nbsp;<br />
<P><A name="TS4">(4) O4FE UTF-8 to CodePage translation --</A><br />
<P>For each string which might contain UTF-8 codes, O4FE steps through the string skipping bytes with 0x00 to 0x7F values. When it finds a byte with an 0xC2 or greater value, it decodes the 2 or greater byte UTF-8 sequence. If it instead finds a byte in the 0x80 to 0xC1 range, it returns the remainder of that string without decoding; the likelihood that Opera will produce an invalid UTF-8 code is far less than the likelihood the user is looking at a file produced by Opera 5.12.<br />
<P>Decoding of UTF-8 sequences first checks whether the sequence corresponds to a valid UTF-16 code point; if not a '?' replaces the sequence. Valid UTF-16 codes are converted to the selected CodePage using a lookup table; the ###.bin external table or an internal table of the same form. If an identically numbered table is present both internally and as a file, O4FE uses the file.<br />
<P>The table format has 3 sections:<br />
<P>Section 1: Preamble<BR><br />
This consists of two 16 bit words; the first word is the code page number (O4FE doesn't use this number, it's there to identify the file if it has been renamed), the second word is bit-coded for control. Currently only the last bit of that second word is used; when set it indicates a Double Byte Character Set (DBCS), when clear it indicates a Single Byte Character Set (SBCS).<br />
<P>Note: words are stored in Intel order; the low byte is first, followed by the high byte.<br />
<P>Section 2: Unicode table<BR><br />
This consists of an ordered list of Ranges. Each Range consists of 3 words indicating a starting UTF-16 value, an ending UTF-16 value, and the byte offset from the beginning of the overall table/file to the Output code corresponding to the starting UTF-16 value. A lookup consists of searching for the first ending value greater than or equal to the desired value (O4FE uses a binary search for this; one of the DBCS tables has 1489 Ranges and a sequential search would be slow). If the value is also greater than or equal to the starting value for the Range, it lies in that Range, otherwise it is not in any Range and the UTF-8 code is replaced with a '?'. For an in-Range value the starting value is subtracted from the desired value, the difference is doubled for a DBCS table, and the result is added to the offset to find the location of the Output code. The last Range is always a guard which has starting and ending values of 0xFFFF.<br />
<P>Section 3: Output table<BR><br />
This section simply lists the character code bytes (SBCS) or words (DBCS) in the same order as the Ranges. Within a Range, there may be up to 6 (SBCS) or 3 (DBCS) sequential '?' characters where the UTF-16 values don't have CodePage equivalents. This keeps the overall table size as small as possible - replacing 5 '?' bytes with a 6 byte Range entry wouldn't be efficient for instance. The 6 byte case could have been handled either way, but the lookup is slightly faster with fewer Ranges.
