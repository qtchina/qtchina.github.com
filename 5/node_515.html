<br />
Yeah this is a common problem with GUI toolkits (it happens with MFC <br />
as well). We also have the same problem with Python.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm not sure how Qt's signals and slots is implemented, but if it's <br />
implemented with some kind of queuing where one thread posts an <br />
event to other thread's event queue, we'll have a problem.<br />
<br />
The problem is some object state is only valid for the duration of <br />
the callback. For example, if on_call_state() callback is called <br />
with state==DISCONNECTED, pjsua-lib only retains the call until this <br />
callback is called, so that the application can retrieve the call <br />
state inside the callback. Once the callback returns, the call will <br />
be destroyed. So if you queue this callback to be processed by <br />
another thread, the handler may not be able to access the call since <br />
it may have been destroyed.<br />
<br />
I think there are two solutions for this:<br />
<br />
One is to make the original callback waits synchronously until the <br />
queue is processed by the other thread.<br />
<br />
The second solution is a lot simpler. You just need to disable the <br />
worker thread in pjsua-lib by setting pjsua_config.thread_cnt to <br />
zero, and create your own Qt thread to poll pjsip, something like:<br />
<br />
   void qt_poller_thread()<br />
   {<br />
     while (!qt_quit) {<br />
       pjsua_handle_events(10);<br />
     }<br />
   }<br />
<br />
With this approach, all callbacks will be called in the context of <br />
your Qt thread. There is still another problem, that is for <br />
callbacks that are called from the media thread context (for <br />
example, on_dtmf_digit(), or the WAV EOF callbacks if you have one). <br />
Since these callbacks are not called by pjsip's worker thread, <br />
you'll probably need to use the queue approach to process them.<br />
<br />
try this.
