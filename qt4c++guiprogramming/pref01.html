Why do programmers like us choose Qt? Sure, there are the obvious answers: Qt's single-source compatibility, its feature richness, its C++ performance, the availability of the source code, its documentation, the high-quality technical support, and all the other items mentioned in Trolltech's glossy marketing materials. This is all very well, but it misses the most important point: Qt is successful because programmers <span class="docEmphasis">like</span> it.</p><p class="docText">How come programmers like one technology, but dislike another? Personally I believe software engineers enjoy technology that feels right, but dislike everything that doesn't. &quot;Feels right&quot; means many things. In the Qt 3 edition of the book, I mentioned Trolltech's phone system as a particularly good example of some particularly bad technology. The phone system didn't feel right, because it forced us to do apparently random things depending on some equally random context. Randomness doesn't feel right. Another thing that doesn't feel right is repetitiveness and redundancy. Good programmers are lazy. What we love about computers compared to, say, gardening is that we don't have to do the same things over and over.</p><p class="docText">Let me emphasize this point with a real-world example: travel reimbursement forms. Typically those forms come as fancy spreadsheets; you fill them out, and you get real money. Simple technology, one should think, and given the monetary incentive this should be a simple task for a grown-up engineer.</p><p class="docText">Reality looks different, though. While nobody else in the company seems to have any problems whatsoever dealing with those forms,the engineers do. And having talked to people in other companies, this seems to be a common pattern. We defer reimbursement until the very last moment, and sometimes we might even forget about it. Why is that? Looking at our form, it's a straightforward, standard procedure. One has to collect receipts, number them, and put those numbers into the proper fields with the date, the location, a description, and the amount. The numbering and copying is designed to ease someone's work, but strictly speaking it is redundant, given that the date, location, description, and amount unambiguously identify a receipt. A tiny bit of extra work to get your money back, one would think.</p><p class="docText">A small annoyance is the per-diem rate, though, which depends on the travel location. There's some separate document somewhere that lists the standardized rates for all the different travel locations. You can't just select &quot;Chicago&quot;; instead you have to look up the rate for Chicago yourself. There's a similar annoyance with the exchange rate field. One has to find the current exchange rate somewhereperhaps with Google's helpand then enter the rate in every single field. Well, strictly speaking, you should wait for your credit card company to issue a statement to you with the actual exchange rate that they used. While this is not hard to do, looking up different pieces of information from different sources, and then copying the relevant items to several places in the form feels needlessly awkward.</p><p class="docText">Programming can be a lot like filling in travel reimbursement forms, only worse. And this is where Qt comes to the rescue. Qt is different. For one thing, Qt makes sense. And for another, Qt is fun. Qt lets you concentrate on your tasks. When Qt's original architects faced a problem, they didn't just look for a good solution, or the simplest solution. They looked for the <span class="docEmphasis">right</span> solution, and then they documented it. Granted they made mistakes, and granted some of their design decisions didn't pass the test of time, but they still got a lot of things right, and what wasn't right could and can be corrected. You can see this by the fact that a system originally designed to bridge Windows 95 and Unix/Motif now unifies modern desktop systems as diverse as Windows XP, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux, and provides the foundation for the Qtopia application platform for embedded Linux.</p><p class="docText">Long before Qt became so popular and so widely used, the dedication of Qt's developers to finding the right solutions made Qt special. That dedication is just as strong today and affects everyone who develops and maintains Qt. For us, working on Qt is a responsibility and a privilege. We are proud of helping to make your professional and open source lives easier and more enjoyable.</p><p class="docText">Matthias Ettrich<br>Oslo, Norway<br>June 2006</p>
