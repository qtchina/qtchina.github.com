Eirik not only enthusiastically encouraged us to write the Qt 3 edition of the book, he also allowed us to spend a considerable amount of our work time writing it. Eirik and Trolltech CEO Haavard Nord both read the manuscript and provided valuable feedback. Their generosity and foresight was aided and abetted by Matthias Ettrich, Trolltech's lead developer. Matthias cheerfully accepted our neglect of duty as we obsessed over the writing of the first edition of this book and gave us a lot of advice on good Qt programming style.</p><p class="docText">For the Qt 3 edition, we asked two Qt customers, Paul Curtis and Klaus Schmidinger, to be our external reviewers. Both are Qt experts with an amazing attention to technical detail, which they proved by spotting some very subtle errors in our manuscript and suggesting numerous improvements. And within Trolltech, alongside Matthias, our most stalwart reviewer was Reginald Stadlbauer. His technical insight was invaluable, and he taught us how to do some things in Qt that we didn't even know were possible.</p><p class="docText">For this Qt 4 edition, we have continued to benefit from the unstinting help and support of Eirik, Haavard, and Matthias. Klaus Schmidinger continued to give valuable feedback, and within Trolltech, our key reviewers were Andreas Aardal Hanssen, Henrik Hartz, Vivi Gl&uuml;ckstad Karlsen, Trenton Schulz, Andy Shaw, and P&aring;l de Vibe.</p><p class="docText">In addition to the reviewers mentioned above, we received expert help from Harald Fernengel (databases), Volker Hilsheimer (ActiveX), Bradley Hughes (multithreading), Trond Kjern&aring;sen (3D graphics and databases), Lars Knoll (2D graphics and internationalization), Sam Magnuson (<tt>qmake</tt>), Marius Bugge Monsen (item view classes), Dimitri Papadopoulos (Qt/X11), Paul Olav Tvete (custom widgets and embedded programming), Rainer Schmid (networking and XML), Amrit Pal Singh (introduction to C++), and Gunnar Sletta (2D graphics and event processing).</p><p class="docText">Extra thanks are due to Trolltech's documentation and support teams for handling documentation-related issues while the book consumed so much of our time, and to Trolltech's system administrators for keeping our machines running and our networks communicating throughout the project.</p><p class="docText">On the production side, Trenton Schulz created the accompanying CD, and Trolltech's Cathrine Bore handled the contracts and legalities on our behalf. Thanks also to Nathan Clement for the Troll illustrations. And last but not least, thanks to Lara Wysong from Pearsons, for handling the production practicalities so well.</p>
